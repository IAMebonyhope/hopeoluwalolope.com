## **Intentional 2026: Plan With Purpose**

Are you tired of setting goals that fade by February and you’re ready to *actually follow through?* Then this experience was created for you.

This is **not just another vision board session**.

This is not a session for *figuring out what goals to have*.

This is a space for people who already have **ideas, desires, and convictions** for 2026, and are ready to bring **structure, clarity, and intention** to them.

Whether your goals include certifications, career growth, health, faith, finances, relationships, reading more books, expanding your network, or becoming a better version of yourself; this experience is designed to help you **organize those goals, breathe life into them, and build systems that support execution**.

⚠️ Please only sign up if you intend to attend and fully participate.

We are intentionally keeping this group **small and focused** to create a meaningful, committed space.
